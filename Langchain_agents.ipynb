Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name Master. After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as AlphaGo Zero, which was completely self-taught without learning from human games.

AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the rules.\n",
